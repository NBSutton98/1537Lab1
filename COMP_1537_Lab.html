<p> Naruto was the first cartoon that I connected with as a young person, and was always a safe space for me to return to, I also have a Naruto tattoo!</p>
<p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the
Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to
become Hokage.
